## Coverage improvement

### Individual tests

<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>

<Group member name> **Karina Sudnicina**

Test 1: get_bound(t)

Coverage before: <br>![get_bound without tests](https://github.com/noracai26/SimpleParsing/assets/76873802/f370b19e-382e-4de3-bb8b-1c51e5645143)<br>
Coverage after: <br> ![get_bound with tests](https://github.com/noracai26/SimpleParsing/assets/76873802/de09d705-46b9-448c-b2a0-4ff9d19eb5c0)


<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>
As seen from the screenshot, the function was initially not covered completely by test cases. I have added the test cases to make sure all of the brances are covered. As a result, the function is covered by 100%
and the number of 'missing' statements in utils.py got decreased by 1 - from 77 to 76.

<br><br>

Test 2: def _description_from_docstring(docstring: dp.Docstring)

Coverage before: <br> ![description_from_docstring_before](https://github.com/noracai26/SimpleParsing/assets/76873802/070a6577-33d7-4159-af7f-2f35631175da)
Coverage after: <br>![description_from_docstring_after](https://github.com/noracai26/SimpleParsing/assets/76873802/d51ca4b7-f9d7-4970-9623-e3aa70e3ad1e)

<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>
Similarly, the function was not covered completely. Adding new test cases for this function raised the coverage of decorators.py file for 2% - from 91 to 93. The function is now covered by 100% and the 'missing' statements number has also decreased by 1 - from 6 to 5.

Test 1: test/test_ugly_example_after.py

added new test:

percentage of improvement: 60%%

The coverage of the function def __post_init__ went from 40% to 100%, this is because the coverage for the function has been improved by writing test case to cover the second and third branch, which were not previously covered.

Test 2: test/test_base.py

enhanced existing test:

The coverage of the function def contains_dataclass_type_arg went from 86% to 100%, the increase is caused by the enhancement of test cases that that covers the second branch of the function, which was not previously covered.

In the original test file, there was no test case for this function, so the coverage of this function was 0%, then I added the test code for this function, then its coverage increased to 100%.

Test 2: getattr_recursive

old coverage results: (coverage: 0%)

percentage of improvement: 100%

Same as the function in Test 1, there was no test case for this function, so the old covearage was 0%, after I added test case for it, the coverage of this function increased to 100%.
